This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset and improper optimization. The error message might not be very descriptive, but it usually manifests as slow rendering, unresponsive UI, or even crashes.  The root cause lies in inefficient rendering of list items, especially when dealing with dynamic content or complex components within each list item.
